## Abstract

Here we review the development of optical neural interfaces, focusing on hardware designed for optical control of neural activity, integrated optical control and electrical readout, and ==optical== readout of population and ==single-cell== neural activity in freely ==moving mammals==. 







## Intro

Conventional methods for neuron activity in brain: 

electrophysiological methods have been widely used to record the activity of neurons in behaving animals. But is is not capable of targeting genetically specified cell types



### Challenges and requirements

- Sub-micron spatial resolution

- millisecond-scale time resolution 

- at depth in scattering brains



imaging speed limited by serial 3D scanning of 2P excitations focus:

scanning method

light-field method



Difficulties: 

cell motion 

huge data, 3D registration, 

actual volume rate also limited by fluorescence brightness

Traditional technique is not enough for high sampling rate



Properties of neuron system:

Under most conditions, neurons are not migrating in 3D.

Thus, Because of the sparse activities of neurons circuity, we can use random scanning technique.







## optical control of neural activity

### genetically encoded optical actuators



Development of a toolbox of genetically encoded optical actuators from microbial organisms (__ref. 8-21__). Better than electrical stimulation, genetically encoded actuators is capable of targeting genetically specified cell types.

In the figure, currently available tools allow for induction of action potentials (ChR-family light-gated cation channels shown, left ), silencing of neural activity (HR-family light-gated chloride pumps shown, middle ; proton pumps may also be used), modulation of intracellular signaling cascades, OptoXR family shown, right.





### single-site intracranial light delivery

It was not practical to stimulation deep within the brain, or for flexible behavioral control in freely moving animals. 



The ﬁrst demonstration of optical control of behavior in freely moving rodents, in 2007 (__ref. 27__), showing optogenetic control of behavioral state transitions (sleep/wake) in freely moving mice.

### light sources

Generally, light sources are CW laser or LED.  Fiber-coupled lasers enable delivery of illumination directly into neural tissue. 

Note: control of neuronal ﬁring upon photostimulation requires relatively low irradiance values at the microbial opsin-expressing cell (1–5 mW/mm^2^), due to the tissue scattering and absorption. Experimentally, we usually delivery up to 100  mW.



LED: 

### multisite optical-neural interfaces



### wireless optigenetic control 

several devices have been developed that seek to move toward wireless control of intracranial light delivery (__ref. 37, 41, 48__).
